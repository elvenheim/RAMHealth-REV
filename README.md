Good Day Everyone!

I am Rich Diamond P. Custodio a Computer Engineering student from Asia Pacific College

This project called RAMHEALTH-REV is a remake of my old project "RAM Health", which literally has the worst possible things that many could experience or see from a website. Basically, I've found ways to improve the user interfaces and functions for the user experience.

By the way, this is a project in compliance for the courses SOFTDES/SOFTLAB during my 2nd year, but since I haven't accomplish all of the system functions that time, I need to retake the subjects during my 3rd year 3rd semester.

Thank you.


Note 07-08-2024:

I have finally finished creating the website, now it can be fully deployed and possibly be used as a reference for creating a website that has all-in-one(?) functions, in a beginner scale.
